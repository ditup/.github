# ditup

_do it together_

_Turn ideas into collaborative action_

🌱 **Early Stage**

## About

**ditup** is an open-source initiative building a decentralized social network where you:

- Find like-minded folks
- Share ideas and issues
- Build projects together
- Own your data

You can learn more in [ditup/ditup](https://github.com/ditup/ditup/) and [docs](https://docs.ditup.org).

You can also try out the [web application (WIP)](https://ditup.org)

## Repositories

- [ditup/ditup](https://github.com/ditup/ditup/) - main monorepo

## Features

Features will be built incrementally. You can contribute to this project, or you can build new applications implementing/extending these features.

- Add interests to my profile and share them with others.
- Find and connect with people who share my interests.
- Keep track of issues in my environment that I see and care about (local or global).
- Keep track of my ideas.
- Share my ideas and issues publicly or with specific people. Explore and adopt other issues and ideas.
- Organize and join local or remote events based on shared passions.
- Start or join a project, and collaborate on addressing the issues and implementing the ideas.

Each incremental version should be usable and useful on its own.
