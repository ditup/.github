## About

**ditup** is an open-source initiative building a decentralized social network where you:

- Share ideas and issues
- Build projects together
- Own your data

## Technology Stack

## Repositories

## Features

will be built incrementally. You can contribute to this project, or you can build new applications implementing/extending these features.

- Add interests to my profile and share them with others.
- Find and connect with people who share my interests.
- Keep track of issues in my environment that I see and care about (local or global).
- Keep track of my ideas.
- Share my ideas and issues publicly or with specific people. Explore and adopt other issues and ideas.
- Organize and join local or remote events based on shared passions.
- Start or join a project, and collaborate on addressing the issues and implementing the ideas.

Each incremental version should be usable and useful on its own.
