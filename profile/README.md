![Project Status Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-incubation,_concept,_planning-pink)

🌱 **Early Stage:** The project is in the concept and planning phase. This is a fresh restart based on years of prior work. [Michal](https://github.com/mrkvon) works on this solo at the moment, but welcomes collaborators to help design and build the next version. [Join the effort](#contributing)!

## About

**ditup** is an open-source initiative building a decentralized platform where users can:

- Meet people who care about similar things.
- Keep, share, and discover ideas and issues.
- Collaborate with like-minded folks on meaningful projects.

## Technology Stack

Building on top of Universal Social Network - a decentralized network independent of companies, platforms and apps, where members own their identity and data.

- [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/) is used for decentralized online identity and data storage.
- [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) is used for communication between decentralized actors.

## Features

will be built incrementally. You can contribute to this project, or you can build new applications implementing/extending these features.

- Add interests to my profile and share them with others.
- Find and connect with people who share my interests.
- Keep track of issues in my environment that I see and care about (local or global).
- Keep track of my ideas.
- Share my ideas and issues publicly or with specific people. Explore and adopt other issues and ideas.
- Organize and join local or remote events based on shared passions.
- Start or join a project, and collaborate on addressing the issues and implementing the ideas.

Each incremental version should be usable and useful on its own.
